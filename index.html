            <h3 class="headline">Here's a time line of Steve Jobs life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1955</strong> - Born in San Francisco, California, U.S.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1976</strong> - Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
                    computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the
                    first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1979</strong> - Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was
                    mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1984</strong> - Breakthrough of Macintosh, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI.
                    The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple
                    LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1985</strong> - Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with
                    the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's
                    members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in
                    computers for higher-education and business markets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2001</strong> - The original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based
                    on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2003</strong> - Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

                    in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in
                    Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its
                    retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the
                    Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read
                    "Steve, don't be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2006</strong> - He further expanded Apple's recycling programs to any US customer who
                    buys a new Mac.

                    the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2011</strong> - In an interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he
                    had met with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation's shortage of software
                    engineers, and told Obama that he was "headed for a one-term presidency".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2011</strong> - Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the board,
                    "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and
                    expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has
                    come." Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs
                    continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.

                    <strong>2011</strong> - Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. on October 5,
                    2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic
                    neuroendocrine tumor, which resulted in respiratory arrest.
                </li>

                    <strong>"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
                        And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it
                        should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change
                        agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new."</strong>
